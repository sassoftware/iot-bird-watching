Bird Watcher Project Instructions

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi and webcam and make sure that the webcam is taking pictures

2. In echo-client.py, make sure you enter the IP address of your ESP server, along with a
port that is open. Make sure that port number is the same for both 'echo-client.py' and the
'image_stream' window in 'Bird_Watcher.xml'. Transfer this file to your Raspberry Pi.

3. To use the email part of the project, you'll need to be running ESP on a linux server
and have access to the server. If you do, put 'send_pic.sh' in the same directory in which
the server is running. Make sure you input your email address inside this script.

If you don't have access to the server running ESP, you can remove this part of the project
by deleting the 'send_image' window in the ESP project. To remove the window, simply click on
it and hit the delete key.

4. Put 'resnet50_notop.astore' in the same directory in which the ESP server is running.

5. Run the ESP project

6. In the ESP Studio, after the project is running, to the right of the 'Run Test' button, there is a
'Publish' button. Click this, and upload the 'request_astore.csv' file to the 'request_Astore' window

7. Run 'echo-client.py' on the Raspberry Pi

If everything is set up correctly, you should see events populating the windows in the ESP Studio
